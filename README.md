ðŸŽ¶ Welcome to the Lyricaria project, a unique and immersive multiplayer experience that puts players in the shoes of aspiring musicians navigating their way through the highs and lows of the music industry. Players will take control of characters, develop their skills, form bands, and make their mark in a dynamically changing world.

Our goal is to create a vibrant, evolving simulation where the player's journey is shaped by the choices they make, the skills they master, and the relationships they build.
